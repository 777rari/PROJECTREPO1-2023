# PROJECTREPO1-2023
This is our groups project from the spring portion of our QISE course I am taking.
I will be completing a Quantum Coding Project for an Assignment.
By using what we have learned throughout our quantum information science and engineering class we will be able to construct a quantum computing game. 
We will utilize different concepts such as quantum measurement and different gates to program our game. 
These games are played using quantum computers and take advantage of the unique properties of quantum mechanics to create challenging gameplay experiences.
Our group Orion, will be exploring the possibility to create a quantum computing spades game, which utilizes the power of quantum computing to create a more complex and interesting game. 
Spades is a popular card game that is played with a traditional deck of 52 cards. 
The game is typically played with four players, and the objective is to win tricks by playing the highest card in the suit that was led. 
The game is played in rounds, with each round beginning with one player making a bid for the number of tricks they think they can win. 
The other players then have the opportunity to make higher bids or pass. 
The cards are ranked from highest to lowest as follows: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. 
The declarer leads the first card, and the other players must follow suit if they can. If they cannot follow suit, they may play any card. 
The player who plays the highest card of the suit wins the trick, and becomes the leader for the next trick. One of the key aspects of Spades is that spades are always trump. 
This means that a spade can beat any card of another suit, even if the other card is higher in rank. Once all 13 tricks have been played, the scores are tallied. 
The team that made the bid and won the most tricks earns points, while the opposing team earns no points. 
The game continues until one team reaches a predetermined number of points, typically 500 or 1000. 
In the quantum computing version of the game, the rules remain the same, but the underlying mechanics are vastly different. 
In a quantum computing spades game, the cards could be represented by qubits, and the deal is performed using quantum random number generators. 
This process ensures that each player receives a unique set of qubits that cannot be predicted by any classical algorithm. 
We will be able to utilize Qiskit to help us complete our project as it provides tools for creating and manipulating quantum programs and running them on simulators. 
By utilizing concepts such as probability, we can create a code to randomly generate hands for each of the players which can eliminate the need for the dealer. 
Different gates could be used to represent different cards and once measured would produce the card for the game. 
We would also utilize different programming techniques learned to design an interface that is sleek and easy to see for players. 
An idea for the project is to enable access to a simulator for all of the different players and as they have their gates that represent the cards, they can measure them to input whatever card they have selected for that certain suit.
